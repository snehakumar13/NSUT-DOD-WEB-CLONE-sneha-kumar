    <h1>Curry's participation in PARIS OLYMPICS 2024</h1>

    <p>So declared Steph Curry with his hands tucked to the side of his face, as the United States men’s basketball team continued its Olympic reign of dominance, defeating France 98-87 in the final on Saturday, 10 August to win their fifth straight gold medal at Olympic Games Paris 2024.
    The U.S. is atop the international men’s basketball world once again, after Curry scored 24 points — all on 3-pointers — and led the way to a 98-87 win over France in the final at the Paris Games on Saturday night. It was the fifth consecutive gold medal for the U.S. and the 17th in 20 all-time appearances for the Americans at the Games.</p>
